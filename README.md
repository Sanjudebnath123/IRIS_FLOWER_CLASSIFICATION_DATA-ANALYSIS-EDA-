Description of the Iris Dataset 
-

- The Iris dataset contains measurements of various characteristics of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

- There are three species of iris flowers in the dataset: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

- Each species has 50 samples, resulting in a total of 150 samples in the dataset.

- The dataset is balanced, meaning it contains an equal number of samples for each class.

EXPLANATION COLUMNS
-

The Iris dataset consists of measurements of various characteristics of iris flowers belonging to three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The four features measured for each flower are:

- Id
- Sepal length (in centimeters)
- Sepal width (in centimeters)
- Petal length (in centimeters)
- Petal width (in centimeters)
- Species
The dataset contains a total of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three species. It is often used for tasks such as classification, clustering, and visualization.

Summarizing the report findings, here are the results of the analysis :
-

LINE PLOT
-
- Plot a line graph showing the sepal length of the three species of Iris flowers.Use different colors to represent each species.
